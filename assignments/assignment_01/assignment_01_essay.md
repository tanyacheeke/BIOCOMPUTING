## Task 3: Write a 500-1000 word essay describing:

## your motivation for learning bioinformatics
## your goals for the course
## your plan of attack for learning this semester
## why the folder structure you created is good for reproducible research
## your understanding of why we use documented code to do bioinformatics research tasks
## anything else you want me to learn about you, your background, or what/why you hope to learn


I am motivated to learn bioinformatics so that I can gain skills to process and analyze my own sequence data and to be a better advisor to my students. 

My goals for this course are to learn how to use the terminal to code by hand, to learn commonly-used commands, and to improve my computational data skills

My plan of attack for learning this sememester is to:
	# attend lectures at 6:30am, when possible, and follow along on my own computer with the script introduced in lecture
	# re-watch videos to better understand the content, esp. when doing practice sets and assignments
	# do practice sets 
	# do assignments
	# email instructor when stuck so that I can continue to make progress in the course

The folder structure is good for reproducible research so that there is only one file for each e.g., dataset, so that data, scripts, etc are organized, and to make
it easier for others to follow along exactly to see how you did your analysis. This is also a good way for others to catch unintentional errors or to provide feedback
if files are clean and organized and have proper naming

My understanding of why we use documented code to do bioinformatics research tasks is to improve reproducability of our pipeline, so that we can easily follow along
on our own process of thinking when we revisit the files in the future, and to maintain the integrity of the research process

Other things about me - I have been intimidated to learn command-line in the past, believing that because of my limited background in programming that it would be
extremely hard for me. But, by taking it slow, and practicing, and re-watching videos, and having a good instructor, I'm starting to get the hang of it. Slow progress
is better than no progress, and I am feeling more comfortable with it everyday.
